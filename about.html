        <p>
            J. Cole is a rapper and producer who signed on with Jay Z's Roc Nation in 2009 and has produced for
            artists
            like Kendrick Lamar and Janet Jackson.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-header">Who Is J. Cole?</h3>
        <p>
            J. Cole is an MC and producer who has achieved phenomenal success over the last few years, a result of
            the
            long hours he spent grinding hard on the mixtape scene and sharing songs on internet forums. Since
            signing
            to Jay Z’s Roc Nation, he has toured worldwide, sold huge amounts of records, produced for Kendrick
            Lamar
            and even come to the attention of Barack Obama. 
            Along with establishing his own nonprofit foundation, he
            keeps up a busy release schedule. No wonder Drake paid him the highest compliment: “You are looking at
            one
            of the smartest, greatest, most legendary artists of our generation.”
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-header">Born in Germany, Raised in North Carolina</h3>
        <p>
            Jermaine Lamarr Cole was born on January 28, 1985, at a U.S. Army base in Frankfurt, then in West
            Germany.
            His father, an African-American soldier, left his mother, a white German postal worker, when Cole was a
            baby. She moved with him and his older brother, Zach, to Fayetteville, North Carolina, where the family
            lived in trailer parks as she struggled to make ends meet.

            His mom eventually remarried — Cole's stepfather was also in the Army — and the family relocated to a
            nicer
            home. However, the marriage crumbled and the family lost the house as Cole was about to leave for
            college.
            His stepfather had become abusive, particularly toward Zach; after the marriage ended, Cole's mother
            became
            addicted to crack under the influence of a new boyfriend.
            <img class="about-cole-img" src="./Images/the-j-cole-chronicles.jpeg" />

            It was in Fayetteville that Cole's passion for music found an early outlet when he joined the Terry
            Sanford
            Orchestra as a violinist. He also began to teach himself rapping and production, rapping first as Blaza,
            then as Therapist — “We used to look through the dictionary for rap names,” he recalled later — before
            hooking up with a local group called Bomm Sheltuh.

            He held down a number of part-time jobs as a teenager while he honed his production skills, including a
            stint at an ice hockey rink where he had to dress up as a kangaroo mascot. After graduating from high
            school, Cole moved to New York and attended St John’s University, graduating magna cum laude in 2007
            with a
            degree in communications.

        <h3 class="section-header">Getting Signed to Roc Nation</h3>
        <p>
            His debut mixtape, The Come Up, also came out in 2007. It was largely self-produced, but also saw
            him
            rapping over beats from Kanye West, Large Professor and Just Blaze. A track called "Lights Please"
            from his
            second mixtape, The Warm Up (2009), came to the attention of the producer and music exec Mark Pitts,
            who
            played it to Jay Z. Ironically, Cole had attempted to give Jay Z a copy himself, after waiting
            outside a
            studio to meet his idol for three hours — only to be rebuffed with the line “Man, I don't want that
            shit.”
            But Pitts had Jay Z's ear, and the mogul was impressed with what he heard. Cole signed to Roc Nation
            and
            started to appear as a guest on tracks by Wale, Jay Z and Talib Kweli.

            A third mixtape in 2010, Friday Night Lights, consisted of songs rejected from Cole’s debut studio
            album.
            That album, Cole World: The Sideline Story, finally saw the light of day in 2011 and would go on to
            be
            certified platinum. Critics hailed a promising artist, with the L.A. Times praising the “satisfying
            confidence” of his rhymes and the “slickly inventive beats.”
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-header">Going No. 1: '2014 Forest Hills Drive' & '4 Your Eyez Only'</h3>
        <p>
            Cole's sophomore album, Born Sinner, had its release date moved numerous times so as not to clash
            with other
            big releases. When it eventually came out in June 2013, it was another success. Kendrick Lamar and
            50 Cent
            were among the guests, on an album that was warmly, but not ecstatically, received.

            With momentum building, 2014 Forest Hills Drive came out in December 2014 and premiered at No. 1 on
            the
            Billboard 200, despite a lack of advance singles or marketing. It won several awards, including
            Billboard
            Rap Album of the Year, and was later certified double platinum. This was impressive for an album
            that had no
            guest appearances, although some critics felt his political stances in real life were not reflected
            on an
            album that often strayed into sex rhymes. “It’s time for the Cole who marches in the streets to
            start
            showing up on record,” said Rolling Stone, referring to Cole’s visit to Ferguson in August 2014 to
            meet
            those protesting the shooting of Michael Brown.

            His fourth studio album, 4 Your Eyez Only, came out just before Christmas 2016 and also went to No.1.
            Despite a minor controversy over what some saw as lyrical barbs directed at Kanye West and Drake, it
            was
            another guest-free set that found favor. The New York Times suggested that by freeing himself of the
            shackles of big-name guest stars, Cole could take his own artistic path, noting that the album
            “feels as if it were made without the slightest concession to what’s happening elsewhere in the genre.”
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-header">Making History with 'KOD'</h3>
        <p>
            The rapper's audience eagerly welcomed the April 2018 release of his fifth studio album, KOD, which
            shattered Spotify's opening-day streaming record en route to the Billboard top spot. Days later, it
            was
            announced that Cole had become the first artist to debut three simultaneous singles on the Billboard
            Hot
            100, with "Kevin's Heart," "ATM" and KOD's title track all surfacing on the chart.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-header">Establishing His Own Label, Nonprofit Work</h3>
        <p>
            As a thoughtful, contemplative rapper, J. Cole generally stays away from beefing with other artists
            or
            living a gaudy, front-page lifestyle. He runs the Dreamville Records label with his former St.
            John's
            University classmate Ibrahim Hamad, releasing music by up-and-coming artists including Omen, Bas and
            Cozz.<img class="about-dreamvill-img" src="./Images/dreamvill.jpg" />
            
            The label shares a name with his Dreamville Foundation, a non-profit Cole established in his
            hometown. Set
            up to “bridge the gap between the worlds of opportunity and the urban youth of Fayetteville, NC,” it
            runs a
            series of events and programs, including a reading club and essay contests.
            

            Cole is married to Melissa Heholt, with whom he has a child. He recently purchased the childhood
            home after
            which he named his 2014 Forest Hills Drive album, with the intention of developing it into temporary
            rent-free accommodation for single mothers.

            It's actions like this that have made him a rapper that even presidents can praise. Cole was invited
            to the
            White House to meet with Barack Obama in spring 2016, something he rapped about on the track "High
            for
            Hours." Obama later commented: “This is the benefit of having teenage daughters, I actually keep up…
            I love
            J. Cole.” Endorsements don’t come much bigger.
